### 2. Personal Backstory
- Fajgenbaum aspired to be a college quarterback.  
- His life shifted dramatically when his mother was diagnosed with brain cancer.  
- Inspired by this, he pursued medicine.

### 3. Medical Crisis
- While in medical school, Fajgenbaum developed **idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD)**.

- This personal experience revealed the untapped potential of **drug repurposing**.

### 5. Using AI for Drug Discovery
- Motivated by his survival and later his uncle’s cancer diagnosis, Fajgenbaum expanded his focus.  
- During the COVID‑19 pandemic, he launched the **Corona Project** to identify treatment options.  
- He went on to develop **MATRIX**, an **AI-driven platform** for drug repurposing.  
- MATRIX is now **publicly available**, offering researchers a new way to identify potential cures.  

### 6. Opportunities and Risks
- Potential: uncovering hidden treatments for many diseases.  
- Risks: patients or non-specialists may misinterpret AI outputs without medical guidance.  
- Emphasis: AI tools should **support, not replace, medical research and professional oversight**.
