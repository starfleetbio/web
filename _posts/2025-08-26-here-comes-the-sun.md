## Core Facts & Themes

### Clean Energy Transformation
- Solar and renewables are now the **cheapest, fastest-growing** sources of electricity.
- By 2024, **92.5% of new global electricity** came from renewables (U.S. ~96%).
- By mid-2025, fossil fuels dropped to **less than half of U.S. electricity generation**.

### Speed & Scale
- Since 2023, the world has been installing **>1 GW of solar per day**.
- First terawatt of solar took decades, the second just **2 years**.

### Global Examples
- **China:** Leading in scale, becoming the world’s first “electro-state.”
- **California:** Renewables sometimes exceed 100% demand; natural gas use fell **44% in 2 years**.
- **Pakistan:** Solar installs equal to **1/3 of national grid** in under a year; diesel use fell **30–35%**.

### Framing & Messaging
- Focusing on **lower bills, convenience, and resilience** persuades more than climate warnings alone.
- Renewables should be framed as “Costco energy” (affordable, abundant), not “Whole Foods energy.”

### Land Use & Agrivoltaics

- Half of US corn is grown for ethanol production
- **1 acre of solar panels:** generates ~700K miles for a Ford F-150 EV (vs ~25K miles from corn ethanol for a Ford F-150 with cumbustion engine).
- French vineyards saw **60% higher grape yields** under solar arrays.
- Texas farmers benefit from wind leases; livestock graze comfortably around turbines.
- **Balcony solar**: millions in Germany, now legal in Utah.

### Political & Structural Barriers
- **Permitting & transmission** lag behind technological growth.
- Fossil fuel industries spend **hundreds of millions** lobbying against renewables.
- Texas clean energy growth is being undermined by state policies.

### Dual Narrative of Urgency
- June 2023: Earth hit **hottest 12 months in 125,000 years**.
- This coincided with humanity hitting **gigawatt-per-day solar deployment**.
- Message: warming can’t be reversed, but it **can be halted** before civilization suffers irreparable harm.

### Mobilization
- **“Sun Day” on Sept 21, 2025** (autumnal equinox) will be a national day of solar advocacy.

### Decentralization & Power
- Clean energy is **diffuse and decentralized**, unlike fossil fuels.
- This shift could **reshape geopolitics** and empower communities globally.
