## Episode: *"mRNA Vaccine For Pancreatic Cancer Continues to Show Promise"*  
**Release Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Podcast:** Science Friday

### Episode Summary

- **Focus on Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine**  
  A research team at **Memorial Sloan Kettering** is developing an **mRNA vaccine targeting pancreatic cancer**, which is notoriously hard to treat.

  - In an initial **small-scale clinical trial**, 16 pancreatic cancer patients received the vaccine.  
  - Of those, **half (8 patients)** showed a **strong immune response**.  
  - Follow-up results revealed that in **6 of those responders**, the cancer had **not relapsed after three years**.

- **Guest Appearance**  
  The episode features an interview with **Dr. Vinod Balachandran**, an associate attending surgeon and Director of The Olayan Center for Cancer Vaccines at Memorial Sloan Kettering. He confirms that their work has **not been impacted by the funding cuts** so far.

# Summary of Nature Paper: Personalized RNA Neoantigen Vaccines in Pancreatic Cancer

**Citation**: Rojas et al., *Nature* (2023), "Personalized RNA
neoantigen vaccines stimulate T cells in pancreatic cancer", Nature 618,
144--150. [DOI:
10.1038/s41586-023-06063-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06063-y)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background & Rationale

-   **Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)** has \~12% five‑year
    survival, with poor response to immunotherapy due to low mutation
    burden and weak natural immunity.
-   Some survivors develop **T‑cell responses** to their tumors,
    inspiring trials of **personalized mRNA vaccines** that encode
    tumor‑specific neoantigens.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Design & Methods

-   **Phase I trial** (NCT04161755) with PDAC patients after surgical
    resection.
-   Treatment sequence:
    1.  **Atezolizumab** (anti‑PD‑L1 antibody)
    2.  **Autogene cevumeran** (personalized mRNA vaccine encoding up to
        20 neoantigens)
    3.  **mFOLFIRINOX** chemotherapy
-   Endpoints: safety, T‑cell induction, and **18‑month recurrence‑free
    survival (RFS)**.
-   T‑cell tracking via **CloneTrack**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Findings

-   **Feasibility & Safety**: Personalized vaccines manufactured and
    administered successfully, with good tolerability.
-   **Immune Response**: 8 of 16 patients mounted strong,
    **neoantigen‑specific T‑cell responses**.
-   **Magnitude**: Vaccine‑induced T‑cell clones sometimes made up to
    **10% of circulating T cells**.
-   **Durability**: Responses persisted up to **3 years** and expanded
    with boosters.
-   **Clinical Correlation**:
    -   Responders: **median RFS not reached**.
    -   Non‑responders: **median RFS ≈ 13.4 months**.
    -   Difference was statistically significant (**P = 0.003**).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interpretation & Implications

-   **Proof of principle**: Personalized mRNA vaccines can work in
    PDAC.
-   **Clinical promise**: Immune responses correlated with delayed
    recurrence.
-   **Next steps**: Larger randomized trials to confirm benefit and
    refine patient selection.

### Bottom Line

This Phase I trial demonstrates that **personalized mRNA vaccines** can
successfully stimulate long‑lasting, tumor‑targeted T‑cell immunity in
pancreatic cancer. Responders showed delayed recurrence, supporting
larger trials to test this strategy in one of the deadliest cancers.
