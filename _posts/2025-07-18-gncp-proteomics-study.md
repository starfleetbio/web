The Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium ([GNPC](https://www.neuroproteome.org)) is a major neurodegenerative disease biomarker discovery effort. Launched in 2023, the GNPC has published [four papers](https://www.nature.com/collections/ecegeajbhg) in Nature Medicine this week. Three of the four are open access.
