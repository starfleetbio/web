## The best work we do is the kind that makes us unnecessary



Kristen Cleveland, Project Management Professional (PMP), is an executive consultant with 20+ years of experience guiding large-scale data, strategy, and modernization initiatives across biotech, pharma, and government. Her work has spanned high-throughput sequencing, cloud platforms, and program management for complex research environments, with a focus on aligning technical solutions to real scientific needs. At StarfleetBio, Kristen brings this experience to rare and age-related disease challenges, partnering with teams to solve hard problems while building the internal structures and skills they need to sustain progress. She believes success is measured not by continued reliance on consultants, but by the ability of teams to move forward after working with StarfleetBio.
