## What is behind the name?

I had an ex-coworker say to me recently...

*"I always told [person X] that working at [company Y] felt like being in Starfleet to me."*

Readers of this post might have no idea what Starfleet is, but as a co-founder of company Y, that statement made me feel so very proud, since  building a company like Starfleet was exactly what I was shooting for.

## What is Starfleet?

Starfleet is a **fictional organization in the Star Trek universe**, serving as the exploratory, scientific, diplomatic, and defensive force of the United Federation of Planets.

## What are Starfleet values?

* Exploration and Discovery
* Peace and Diplomacy
* Cooperation and Unity
* Respect for Life
* Courage and Determination
* Upholding Justice and Equality

These values sucked me in as a kid and still do.

## Ad astra per aspera

Through hardship to the stars.
